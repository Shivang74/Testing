## 
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of Unit Testing with JUnit, AssertJ, and Mockito:

## 1. JUnit
Purpose: JUnit is a popular testing framework in Java used for writing and running repeatable automated tests.
Annotations:
@Test: Marks a method as a test case.
@BeforeEach: Runs before each test case (setup method).
@AfterEach: Runs after each test case (teardown method).
@BeforeAll and @AfterAll: Setup/teardown at the class level.
@Disabled: Skips a test.
Assertions:
assertEquals(expected, actual): Verifies equality.
assertTrue(condition): Verifies a boolean condition.
assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> { code }): Asserts that the provided code throws an exception.

## 2. AssertJ
Purpose: A rich assertion library for Java, providing more readable and fluent assertions.
Advantages:
Fluent API for more readable tests.
Strong failure messages.
Custom assertions and extended support for collections, exceptions, and more.
Examples:
assertThat(value).isEqualTo(expected): Verifies equality.
assertThat(list).containsExactly(expectedElements): Asserts the contents of a list.
assertThatThrownBy(() -> { code }).isInstanceOf(Exception.class): Asserts that an exception is thrown.

## 3. Mockito
Purpose: Mockito is a mocking framework used to create and configure mock objects for unit testing.
Core Concepts:
Mocks: Simulate the behavior of real objects.
Stubbing: Pre-define responses from methods.
Spying: Partially mock real objects, allowing method calls to be tracked.
Annotations:
@Mock: Creates a mock object.
@InjectMocks: Injects mocks into the object being tested.
@Captor: Captures method arguments for verification.
Key Methods:
when(mock.method()).thenReturn(value): Stubbing method behavior.
verify(mock).method(): Verifies if a method was called.
doThrow().when(mock).method(): Throws an exception for a method call.

This combination of tools allows you to write thorough, readable, and efficient unit tests for your codebase.
